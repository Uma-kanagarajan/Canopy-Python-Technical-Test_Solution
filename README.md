# Canopy-Python-Technical-Test_Solution
Solution for python technical test provided by Mr. Nas from Canopy

Solution Approach as explained below:
1. To extract all the content of PDF files and convert it into excel, I have used pdftable_api converter in python coding. I could sense that I have not done my own coding of extracting PDF tables to CSV file and then to excel sheet. Instead, I used this api tool to extract.
2. Due to limit in the number of page conversions in the api, I have converted only 1 specific page in each given task PDFs. Extracted excel sheet is provided in the Reference folder.
3. Python coding has been done using pandas libraries to convert the excel page into a cleaned dataframe. you can refer the Solution codes in Canopy_Solution_code folder.
4. As you explained in the problem statement, It was easy for me to understand the final dataframe structure for BOS.pdf but I have considered my own dataframe output format for the remaining two PDFs such as JBS.pdf and UBS.pdf
5. Kindly review my code and let me know for any improvements and suggestions.
6. Thanks for providing this task. This definitely helped me to dig deeper into python coding especially using pandas.
